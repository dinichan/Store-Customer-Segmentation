# Store-Customer-Segmentation

This task was created for a virtual internship as a data analyst consultant at KPMG.

Spocket Central Pty Ltd, a company that sells bicycle equipment, is the client in this project.

Therefore in project, I am expected to suggest customers who will have the greatest beneficial effect on the company's organization.
To accomplish this, I will use RFM and K-Means clustering techniques to create customer segmentation.


A notebook can be used to access the data set used in this project.
